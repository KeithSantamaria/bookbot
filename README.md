# Bookbot

Requires Python3 to run

Usage `python3 main.py <path_to_book>`

This is a quick python script to get my coding skills warmed up again as I go to bigger projects

Script reads a text file, and then prints out the word count and then the sorted count of each alphabetic character

Project idea came from the [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) course. Would recommend if you are learning or want to refresh your Python skills
